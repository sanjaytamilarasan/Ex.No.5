## Aim  
To test and compare how **Instructional Prompt Pattern** responds to naïve (unstructured) prompts versus refined (structured) prompts across different scenarios, and to analyze the **quality, accuracy, and depth** of the generated responses.  

---

## AI Tools Required  
- ChatGPT (GPT-5)  
- Instructional Prompt Pattern  

---

## Explanation  
**Prompt Types:**  
1. **Naïve Prompt** – broad, unstructured, minimal context.  
2. **Structured Prompt (Instructional)** – clear, detailed, and step-by-step instructions guiding the AI.  

In the Instructional Pattern, the prompt is designed with **specific requirements, format, and constraints** to ensure predictable and accurate outputs.  

---

## Test Scenarios  
1. Creative Story Generation  
2. Factual Question Answering  
3. Concept Summarization  
4. Giving Advice or Recommendations

## Observations  

### Table – Naïve vs. Instructional Prompts  

| Scenario       | Naïve Prompt                           | Response Quality                        | Instructional Prompt                                                                                   | Response Quality                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Story          | “Write me a story.”                   | Short, generic, no theme.                | “Write a 300-word science fiction story where a robot discovers emotions on Mars. Include setting, conflict, and resolution.” | Rich detail, clear structure, engaging.   |
| Factual Q      | “Tell me about World War 2.”          | Long, unfocused, missing chronology.     | “Summarize World War 2 in 200 words, covering causes, key battles, and outcomes in bullet points.”       | Concise, structured, accurate.            |
| Summarization  | “Explain photosynthesis.”              | Overly broad, lengthy explanation.       | “Summarize photosynthesis in 5 bullet points highlighting light and dark reactions. Use simple language.”| Precise, easy to understand, well-organized.|
| Advice         | “How to stay healthy?”                 | Generic advice, repetitive.              | “List 5 daily habits for working professionals to improve physical and mental health, with one-line justification for each.” | Practical, specific, context-aware.       |

---

## Analysis  
- **Naïve prompts** → produced vague, generic, or overly long answers.  
- **Instructional prompts** → consistently yielded higher **quality** (clarity, relevance), stronger **accuracy** (facts in correct order), and better **depth** (detailed but structured).  
- For **creative tasks**, structured prompts ensured richer storytelling.  
- For **factual and summarization tasks**, they reduced unnecessary detail and improved clarity.  
- **Advice/recommendations** became more context-specific and useful.  

---

## OUTPUT  
The implementation of the **Instructional Prompt Pattern** showed that refined prompts significantly improved the **structure, clarity, and depth** of responses compared to naïve prompts across all scenarios.  

---

## RESULT  
The experiment was executed successfully. The **Instructional Prompt Pattern** proved to deliver more accurate, detailed, and high-quality outputs than naïve prompting.
